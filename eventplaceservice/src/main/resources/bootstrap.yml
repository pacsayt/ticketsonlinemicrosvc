# The properties to configure the Config Client must necessarily be read in before the rest of the application’s
# configuration is read from the Config Server, during the bootstrap phase.
# Specify the client’s spring.application.name and the location of the Config Server (spring.cloud.config.uri) in configuration-client/src/main/resources/bootstrap.properties, where it will be loaded earlier than any other configuration.
